# Gold Channel Movie Streaming App - Project Overview

## 1. Registration
The registration feature will allow users to create an account by providing their email or using social login options (e.g., Google). This process will require form validation, email verification, and integration with third-party authentication providers for social logins.

**Key Considerations:**
- User input validation (email, password, etc.)
- API integration for authentication
- Handling social login flows with OAuth2
- Session management and security (JWT or token-based authentication)

## 2. Profile
Users will be able to view and update their profile, which includes personal details like name, email, avatar, and subscription status. Users can also manage preferences related to their viewing experience.

**Key Considerations:**
- Edit profile feature (name, avatar, etc.)
- API integration for profile update
- Security around personal information updates
- Profile synchronization across multiple devices

## 3. Subscription
Users will be able to choose from different subscription plans, which grant access to premium content. This section will include a subscription flow with plan selection, trial options, and linking to the payment gateway.

**Key Considerations:**
- Multiple subscription plans (monthly, yearly, etc.)
- Subscription state management (active, trial, expired)
- Integration with third-party payment providers (Google Play Billing, Stripe)
- Handling upgrades, downgrades, and cancellations

## 4. Payment
The payment module will allow users to securely pay for subscriptions and additional services (like in-app purchases). It will include payment processing, invoice management, and transaction history.

**Key Considerations:**
- Integration with payment gateways (Google Play, Apple Pay, Stripe, etc.)
- Security and compliance with PCI standards
- In-app purchase flow for iOS and Android
- Subscription renewal and billing cycle management

## 5. Downloads
Users can download movies and TV shows to watch offline. This feature will involve background download management, encryption of downloaded files, and UI to manage downloaded content.

**Key Considerations:**
- Background downloads using WorkManager/Foreground Services
- Storage management (handle low storage, file sizes)
- Download progress tracking and notifications
- Encrypted downloads to protect content from unauthorized access
- Handling device-specific download limits and deletion

## 6. Streaming
Streaming functionality will allow users to watch content on-demand, with support for different quality levels based on network conditions (adaptive bitrate). This will also include real-time buffering and resume capability.

**Key Considerations:**
- Integration with a streaming service or CDN (e.g., HLS, DASH)
- Adaptive streaming based on network bandwidth
- Playback controls (play, pause, seek, forward, rewind)
- Cast support (Chromecast, AirPlay)
- Seamless transition between streaming and offline playback

## 7. Watchlist
Users can save movies and TV shows to their watchlist for later viewing. This will be synced across devices and stored persistently in the backend.

**Key Considerations:**
- Persistent storage using Room/Realm for local caching
- Sync watchlist with server-side backend via API
- Add/remove functionality from watchlist
- UI to display watchlist items in a grid/list format

## 8. Search
Search functionality will allow users to search for movies, TV shows, actors, and genres. This will be backed by a search engine and should provide real-time suggestions as users type.

**Key Considerations:**

- Search suggestions (auto-complete) with caching for better performance
- Filters and sorting options for search results (by genre, rating, etc.)
- Pagination for handling large search results

## 9. Genre
Users can browse and filter content by genre (e.g., Action, Comedy, Drama). This will include a dynamic filtering system to update content lists in real time based on user selection.

**Key Considerations:**
- Genre-based content filtering UI
- Real-time API integration to fetch genre-based content
- Handle multiple genre selections (intersection vs. union)
- Display dynamic content lists based on user selections

## Additional Considerations

- **Notifications:** Implement push notifications to inform users about new releases, subscription renewals, and special offers.
- **Multi-language Support:** Localize the app to support different languages based on user preferences or region.

- **Scalability:** Ensure that the app can handle a large number of users simultaneously streaming or downloading content.

## Conclusion
This app will provide users with a complete movie streaming experience, combining ease of use, high-quality content delivery, and robust security. The development will require seamless integration with third-party services, efficient data management, and an emphasis on UI/UX to ensure smooth interaction.
